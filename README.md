LeadScoreAI Project Overview
Objective
The LeadScoreAI project aims to build a machine learning model to predict the value of sales leads, enabling sales teams to prioritize high-quality leads for conversion. This is a binary classification problem where leads are labeled as either high-quality (likely to convert) or low-quality (less likely to convert).
Project Description

Problem: Classify sales leads based on their likelihood of conversion using features such as demographic information, online behavior, and past interactions.
Data: The dataset includes features about leads and a binary target variable (0 or 1) indicating conversion status.
Skills Required:
Classification: Using algorithms like Logistic Regression, Random Forest, or XGBoost.
Feature Importance: Identifying key features that drive predictions.
Model Evaluation: Evaluating performance using metrics like AUC, F1-Score, Precision, and Recall.


Difficulty Level: 8/10, requiring a deeper understanding of business metrics and machine learning techniques.

Project Steps

Data Collection and Preparation:
Load and explore the dataset.
Handle missing values and encode categorical features.
Normalize or standardize features.


Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
Analyze data distributions and relationships between features.
Visualize data using charts (e.g., histograms, correlation matrices).


Model Selection and Training:
Select appropriate algorithms (e.g., Random Forest, XGBoost).
Train models and tune hyperparameters.


Model Evaluation:
Evaluate performance using AUC, F1-Score, and other metrics.
Visualize results with ROC curves and confusion matrices.


Feature Importance Analysis:
Identify and interpret the most influential features.
